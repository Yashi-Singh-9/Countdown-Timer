# Countdown-Timer
A simple countdown timer that dynamically displays the time remaining until the New Year in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a responsive design, hover animations, and a serene mountain background. When the countdown ends, it shows a festive "Happy New Year!" message.
